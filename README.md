# SMART
A user interface that reads satellite images in .tiff format and displays the image on the program. Automatically imports raster/greyscale .tiff layers and relevant .xml files with some important information captured. Has several functions like on-the-fly coordinate tracking, zooming/ sliding features, button to convert and display a greyscaled NDVI layer from the imported .tiff file etc.

Code that I wrote in Java during my internship at SMART from March 2018 - August 2018. My first ever project done with no prior coding experience/ learning to code in Java on the job. Shout out to my dad for his guidance and assistance and of course, stackoverflow, for having answers for all conceivable questions.

Code will be uploaded in parts/ whenever I'm not procrastinating.
